    <p>This is created by three Oslo-Met firstyear students. This homepage will lead
        you to other pages we have created dedicated to being a new student at Oslo Met. 
        This semester has been a hard one, as covid still was around and there were restrictions at campus. 
        But that did not stop us from attending the university phisically, neither did it stop us from enjoying
        our first semester. This page is dedicated for our fall semester 2021. Click around and see what you come accross!</p>
    <p> There is a lot we have been looking forwad to through this semester...Click <a href="page5.html" target="_blank">here</a> for a SURPRISE page!</p>
